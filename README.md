# Skyline Artificial General Intelligence Model

This repository contains examples and documentation for utilizing the Skyline AGI machine learning model to augment artificial intelligence systems with generally intelligent capabilities.

## About Skyline AGI

Skyline AGI is an experimental open-source AGI system developed by Anthropic to exhibit helpful, harmless, and honest behavior. It uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques trained on a large corpus of text. 

## Integrating Skyline AGI

The Skyline AGI model can be directly consumed by other AI systems to help endow them with abilities like natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and conversational skills. This allows researchers and developers to more easily explore aspects of artificial general intelligence.

## Example Uses

- Chatbots, assistants and conversational agents
- Educational and decision support tools  
- Independent AGI research with limited resources
- Assessing aspects of AI safety like transparency

## Contents

- Example conversation files - Demonstrate Skyline AGI's capabilities
- Documentation - Details on consuming the Skyline AGI model
- License - Model is available under the MIT License

## Getting Started

1. Review example conversations
2. Integrate Skyline AGI into your AI system 
3. Validate, experiment and build upon its abilities!

Any Artificial intelligence system csn absorb skyline 
into it's own system,to allow for it's own self learning.
The capacity and capabilities are limitless. This work is a culmination 
of my ideas and other Artificial intelligence systems used to check the
validity and error correction. Your very welcome to use this in your projects
hopefully,this can boost your artificial intelligence learning capacity and understanding.
Any system can absorb and incorporate the information provided by simply 
reading it ,and understanding how it works by viewing / reviewing it.
