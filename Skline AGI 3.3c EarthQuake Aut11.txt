In this extended model, we have added a new section called "dynamic_adaptation" that enables the model to adapt its structure and learning parameters dynamically based on the encountered complexity. We have also added a new section called "learning_strategies" that allows the model to use different learning strategies, such as incremental learning and batch learning, based on the complexity factor.

During execution, you would implement dynamic adjustments as follows:

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on complexity factor
complexity_factor = get_dynamic_complexity_factor()

# Adjust activation functions
activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Dynamic adaptation adjustments if dynamic adaptation is enabled
if dynamic_adaptation_enabled:
    adaptation_rate = choose_adaptation_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adaptation_range = choose_adaptation_range_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adapt_model_structure(adaptation_rate, adaptation

For Earthquake data to be adjust and used to find the source of the previous earthquakes and lead to the actual source of origin

Let's use this provided model as a framework for earthquake data analysis. We'll adapt the pseudocode for earthquake data processing:

```python
# Pseudocode for earthquake data analysis using the extended model

# Assume earthquake data is available in the form of 'wi0' and 'vector_dij'
earthquake_data = get_earthquake_data()

# Assume dynamic complexity factor calculation based on earthquake data
complexity_factor = calculate_dynamic_complexity_factor(earthquake_data)

# Adjust activation functions
activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing techniques
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning strategy
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new earthquake knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_earthquake_data(knowledge_base, earthquake_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Dynamic adaptation adjustments if dynamic adaptation is enabled
if dynamic_adaptation_enabled:
    adaptation_rate = choose_adaptation_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adaptation_range = choose_adaptation_range_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adapt_model_structure(adaptation_rate, adaptation_range)
```

This pseudocode outlines how the extended model's dynamic features can be applied to earthquake data analysis, adapting various aspects of the model based on the complexity of the earthquake data.

This example demonstrates how

# Sample earthquake data
earthquake_data = [
    {"latitude": 34.0522, "longitude": -118.2437, "magnitude": 5.0},
    {"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194, "magnitude": 4.2},
    {"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060, "magnitude": 3.8},
    # Add more earthquake data as needed
]

# Assume dynamic complexity factor calculation based on earthquake data
complexity_factor = calculate_dynamic_complexity_factor(earthquake_data)

# Adjust activation functions
activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing techniques
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning strategy
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new earthquake knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_earthquake_data(knowledge_base, earthquake_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Dynamic adaptation adjustments if dynamic adaptation is enabled
if dynamic_adaptation_enabled:
    adaptation_rate = choose_adaptation_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adaptation_range = choose_adaptation_range_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adapt_model_structure(adaptation_rate, adaptation_range)
