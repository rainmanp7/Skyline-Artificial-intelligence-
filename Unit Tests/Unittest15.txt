### Key Aspects of the Test:
1. **Complexity Factor Testing**: Simulates high complexity by using large datasets and ensures that the `shared_complexity_factor` is updated and used correctly.
   
2. **Number of Iterations**: Tests that the correct number of iterations is chosen based on the calculated complexity.

3. **Parallel Processing**: Uses a thread pool to test parallel execution of learning strategy adjustments under load.

4. **Cache Invalidation**: Ensures that the cache invalidation logic works as expected when input data or hyperparameters change.

This test covers key components like complexity factor handling, parallel execution, and caching under stress conditions. It can be extended to include other aspects of scalability as needed.
