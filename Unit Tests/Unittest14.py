### Parallel Execution
### Parallel Thread Safety
### 14. **Concurrency and Thread Safety**
   Ensuring the system can handle parallel operations without introducing race conditions or deadlocks is paramount. Given Skyline AGI's reliance on **multiprocessing** and **multithreading**, it's crucial to test whether shared resources like weights, biases, or knowledge bases remain consistent when accessed concurrently.


```python
import unittest
import threading
import multiprocessing
from multiprocessing import Value, Lock
import time

# Assuming shared resources like weights, biases, and knowledge base are represented as global variables
weights_and_biases = {'α': 0.5, 'β': 0.3}
knowledge_base = {'info': 'Initial knowledge'}
shared_lock = threading.Lock()

# Mock function to simulate reading and updating shared resource (weights)
def update_weights_and_biases(shared_lock, weight_key, delta):
    with shared_lock:
        original_value = weights_and_biases[weight_key]
        new_value = original_value + delta
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some processing time
        weights_and_biases[weight_key] = new_value

# Mock function to simulate reading and updating shared knowledge base
def update_knowledge_base(shared_lock, new_info):
    with shared_lock:
        original_info = knowledge_base['info']
        updated_info = original_info + " " + new_info
        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate some processing time
        knowledge_base['info'] = updated_info

class TestConcurrencyAndThreadSafety(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def test_multithreading_shared_resources(self):
        # Create threads to test shared resource access
        thread1 = threading.Thread(target=update_weights_and_biases, args=(shared_lock, 'α', 0.2))
        thread2 = threading.Thread(target=update_weights_and_biases, args=(shared_lock, 'β', 0.1))
        
        # Start threads
        thread1.start()
        thread2.start()
        
        # Join threads to ensure both complete
        thread1.join()
        thread2.join()
        
        # Assert that shared resources are updated correctly without race conditions
        self.assertEqual(weights_and_biases['α'], 0.7)
        self.assertEqual(weights_and_biases['β'], 0.4)
    
    def test_multiprocessing_shared_resources(self):
        # Create a lock for shared access
        process_lock = Lock()

        # Create processes to test multiprocessing with shared resources
        process1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=update_knowledge_base, args=(process_lock, "from Process 1"))
        process2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=update_knowledge_base, args=(process_lock, "from Process 2"))

        # Start processes
        process1.start()
        process2.start()

        # Join processes to ensure both complete
        process1.join()
        process2.join()

        # Assert that the knowledge base is updated consistently
        self.assertTrue("from Process 1" in knowledge_base['info'])
        self.assertTrue("from Process 2" in knowledge_base['info'])

# Run the tests
