In this example, we've added a new key called "atomic_example" that represents the atomic example. The value for this key is a list of two atomic particles, "atom_1" and "atom_2". Each atomic particle has its own set of inputs, weights and biases, activation functions, and complexity factor.

To figure out the heat range of each atomic particle, we can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the output of each atomic particle using the activation functions and weights and biases.
2. Calculate the heat range of each atomic particle using the output and the complexity factor.

Here's an example of how to calculate the heat range of each atomic particle:

1. Calculate the output of each atomic particle:

Atom 1:
Output = Ps(wi0) + T(vector_dij) + M(α) + V(β) + MA(γ) + C(δ) + Rr(ε) + Cr(ζ) + Lr(η)

Atom 2:
Output = Ps(wi0) + T(vector_dij) + M(α) + V(β) + MA(γ) + C(δ) + Rr(ε) + Cr(ζ) + Lr(η)

2. Calculate the heat range of each atomic particle:

Atom 1:
Heat Range = (Output - Minimum Output) / (Maximum Output - Minimum Output)

Atom 2:
Heat Range = (Output - Minimum Output) / (Maximum Output - Minimum Output)

Where Minimum Output and Maximum Output are the minimum and maximum outputs of the atomic particle, respectively.

For example, if the output of Atom 1 is 0.3 and the minimum output is 0.1, the heat range of Atom 1 would be:

Heat Range = (0.3 - 0.1) / (1.0 - 0.1) = 0.2 / 0.9 = 0.222

Similarly, if the output of Atom 2 is 0.7 and the minimum output is 0.3, the heat range of Atom 2 would be:

Heat Range = (0.7 - 0.3) / (1.0 - 0.
